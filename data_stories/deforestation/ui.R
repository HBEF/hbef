                                 ecosystems, and questioned how deforestation would impact
                                 biogeochemical cycles and hydrology. Hubbard Brook 
                                 scientists therefore decided to conduct experiments 
                                 of deforestation and tree cutting at the watershed 
                                 level. In December 1965, Watershed 2 of Hubbard Brook 
                                 was clear-cut and all felled trees were left in place. 
                                 Herbicide was applied for a 3 year period to prevent 
                                 regrowth of vegetation. A few years later, Watershed 4
                                 was strip cut in three phases during 1970, 1972, and 1974,
                                 and the felled material was removed. Finally, whole-tree 
                                 harvest was completed in Watershed 5 during 1983-1984, 
                                 where all biomass was clear-cut and removed. Figure 1

                                 4, 5, and 101. During the three years that Watershed 2 was

                                       organic matter falls to the forest floor, microbes
                                       decompose the nitrogen in this dead organic matter
                                       into ammonium and nitrify the ammonium into nitrate.
                                       When plants are present, they reabsorb the ammonium
                                       and nitrate through their roots. However, if trees
